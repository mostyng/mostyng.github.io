	  	<h1>WeWork – Office Prototypes</h1>
	  	<p>
	  		One of my first projects at Hush involved concepting and prototyping possible smart-interiors for WeWork's future modular office spaces. Hush looked to express WeWork's motto of "Make a life, not just a living" in its new spaces through various architectural and interactive interventions. 
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
	  		My role in this project consisted of conducting research, creating user journeys, storyboards, and creating interface animations for a final animatic prototype.

	      			<li>
	      				Individual lighting control is a critical factor in worker productivity. Studies have shown that when users can adjust the illuminance that it has a positive effect on their satisfaction with the environmental conditions. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132317300501#cebib0010" target="blank">Source</a>

	  		WeWork's Open Skies is a mutable digital ceiling that addresses the passage of time and the need to visually connect with the sky over the course of the day. Individuals interface with this ceiling through a mobile interface that gives them immediate control. The colors provided are geared towards productivity and balancing circadian rhythms.

	        	  <p class="rightText largeText">
	        	  For this concept, we detail three motivators for an environmental notification system:</p>
	        		<ol class="rightText largeText">
	        			<li>
	        				Notifications are distracting. There is evidence that constant device notifications can lead to symptoms adult ADHD. Studies have shown that turning off notifications can cause anxiety.
	        				<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291618379_Silence_Your_Phones_Smartphone_Notifications_Increase_Inattention_and_Hyperactivity_Symptoms" target="blank">Source</a>
	        			</li><br>
	        			<li>
	        				Reminders can build good habits. Setting up a visible reminder and linking my new habit with a current behavior makes it much easier to change. Success in this system does not hinge upon motivation or memory. It doesn’t matter if it’s working out or eating healthy or creating art, you can’t expect yourself to magically stick to a new habit without setting up a system that makes it easier to start. <a href="http://usabilitypanda.com/publications/StawarzCoxBlandford2015-habit-apps.pdf" target="blank">Source</a>
	        			</li><br>
	        			<li>
	        				Create awareness not disruption. A recent study conducted at the University of California, Irvine indicated that most people take 23 minutes and 15 seconds to recover from an interruption. That’s actually a pretty long time, and it can really add up over the course of a day. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/opinion/sunday/a-focus-on-distraction.html" target="blank">Source</a>

	    		GR software uses an existing calendar API and the users own data to drive the lights. A mobile and desktop interface allows direct user engagement through their personal calendar.

	        			<li>
	        				Larger work surfaces invite deeper collaboration.
	        				While smaller displays suit individual productivity, it is important that the tools for collaborative work reflect multi-user needs. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002073739190039A" target="blank">Source</a>

	        			<li>
	        				Sound can make or break a space. Conversational speech is the most distracting noise in open-offices, and once focus is broken, it can take 10+ minutes to return concentration.

	    	<h2>Takeaways</h2>
	    	<p>
	    		WeWork came to us to create multiple spatial concepts for their product, the office space. The process of concepting and prototyping this project was fast paced, iterative, and felt like multiple design sprints.
	    	</p>
            <p>
        		What we created for WeWork was intended to be a conversation starter for internal stakeholders. These prototypes were made with a desire to aid the well-being, productivity, and sense of community for the office workers of the near future.
