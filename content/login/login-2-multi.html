      	<h1>Increasing account security by encouraging users to setup multiple authentication methods</h1>
      	<p>
      		Following updates to the design of the authentication selection screen, Team Katherine's next task was to enable and encourage users to select multiple authentication methods when creating an account.
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		In November 2021, Login.gov only let users to set up only one Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) method from the MFA Selection screen when first creating an account. 
      	</p>
	  </div>


	<div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 
	  	<h2>The Challenge</h2>
      	<p>
      		Since the current functionality limits users to only setting up one authentication method at account creation, many users don't realize they can add multiple MFA methods from their account page. 
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		Having only one MFA method increases their chances of being locked out and having to delete their account before creating a new one.
      	</p>

	<div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 
      	<h2>Goals & Questions</h2>
      		<p>
      			We looked to determine if enabling and encouraging users to create 2 MFA methods when first creating an account would:
      		</p>
      		<ul class="largeText">
    			<li>
    				Decrease the number of account lockouts / invoke the account recovery process 
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Decrease the number of Login.gov support tickets
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Have users add a second method if it was strongly encouraged by the content
    			</li></br>
    		</ul>

    		<p>The research questions we'd like to answer:</p>

	      	<ul class="largeText">
    			<li>
    				How effective is the text content in convincing users to add a second MFA method on the first MFA selection screen?
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				How often will users only select one MFA method?
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				If users only select one MFA method will they add a 2nd method if they are prompted to later on in the account creation flow?
    			</li></br>
    			<li>
    				How many users will forgo adding a 2nd method even when given another chance to add another MFA method?
    			</li></br>
    		</ul>
	  </div>

	  <div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 
      	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	      	<p>
	      		The team conducted 12 unmoderated usability tests via UserTesting.com.
	      	</p>
	      	<p>
	      		We used a developer sandbox site instead of a prototype to get a better understanding of how people would actually move through the account creation and MFA selection process.
	      	</p>
	  </div>

		<div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 	
	      	<h2>Enable MFA Multi-select</h2>
	      	<p>
	      		Our first move was to switch the radio button to a checkbox. This minor change subtly indicates to users they can select more than one MFA method tile.
	      	</p>
	      	<p>
	      		We then added "We recommend you select at least (2) two different options in case you lose one of your methods"
	      	</p>
	      	<img class="casestudy-pic greyBorder" data-src="login-2-multi/mult-01.png">
		</div>

		<div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 	
	      	<h2>MFA Interstitial Upsell Page</h2>
	      	<p>
	      		In order to capture users who only selected one MFA method, we decided to add an interstitial "upsell" page after a user successfully sets up their first authentication method.
	      	</p>
	      	<p>
	      		We explain to them that adding another authentication method would prevent them from being locked out from their account in case they lose one of their methods.
	      	</p>

		<div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 	
	      	<h2>User Flow</h2>
	      	<p>
	      		The video below illustrates the interstitial upsell screen popping up if a user only selects one MFA method. The primary call to action "Add another method" takes the user back to the authentication selection page to add another method.

	    		<b>7 of 12 participants who selected and set up Phone/SMS ended up with that as their only MFA method.</b><br>

							</li><br>
	    				</ul>
	    			<li>
	    				4 of 12 participants selected 2 MFA methods on the first selection screen but only set up 1 MFA method, by either skipping or failing to set up the 2nd MFA method.
