      	<h1>Team Katherine: Authentication Multi-select</h1>
      	<p>
      		Following updates to the design of the authentication selection screen, Team Katherine next task was to devise ways to get users to select more than one authentication method when creating an account. 
      	</p>
	  </div>


	<div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 
	  	<h2>The Challenge</h2>
      	<p>
      		In November 2021 Login.gov allowed users to set up only one Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) method from the MFA Selection screen when first creating an account. 
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		Since the current functionality limits users to only setting up one authentication method at account creation, many users don't realize they can add multiple MFA methods from their account page. Having only one MFA method increases their chances of being locked out and needing to go through the account recovery process. 
      	</p>
	</div>


	<div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 
      	<h2>Goals & Questions</h2>

      		<p>
      			We are looking to determine which MFA selection design is most successful at:
      		</p>
      		<ul class="largeText">
    			<li>
    				Increasing user confidence in MFA method selection
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Bettering user understanding of MFA methods 
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Decreasing user time to making a selection 
    			</li></br>
    		</ul>

    		<p>The research questions we'd like to answer:</p>

	      	<ul class="largeText">
    			<li>
    				How well do users understand the different MFA methods?
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Do users feel confident in their MFA selections?
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Do icons help users make a quicker decision?
    			</li></br>
    			<li>
    				How does selecting by device first instead of method affect confidence, understanding, and time to making a decision?
    			</li></br>
    		</ul>
	  </div>





	  <div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 
      	<h2>Methodology</h2>

	      	<p>
	      		The team conducted unmoderated usability testing to learn more about how end users select MFA methods. The test was performed through UserTesting.com. Participants independently walked through a series of tasks and questions as they navigated 2 interactive prototypes.
	      	</p>
	      		
	      	<p>
	      		The team conducted 12 usability tests in 2 groups using two prototypes that showed both design versions just in different arrangements in order to diminish the <a href="https://measuringu.com/ut-bias/">recency/primacy bias.</a>
	      	</p>
	  </div>


		<div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 	
	      	<h2>A - Illustration Layout</h2>
	      	<p>
	      		To give new users more context we can provide them with illustrations that accompany each authentication method. The hypothesis was that users could scan through the options faster to make a decision.
	      	</p>

		<div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 	
	      	<h2>B - Questionnaire Layout</h2>
	      	<p>
	      		Using the principle of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/">progressive disclosure,</a> I wanted to have users select one or more devices in a list instead of having to read through each authentication option. The hypothesis was that users would have an easier time selecting the devices they were familiar with before being presented with authentication options.

	      	<h2>Research Results</h2>
	      		<p>
	      			All users were able to successfully select an MFA method and comprehend how it secured their Login.gov account.
				</p>

	      		<b>4 of 6 users from Group B had positive comments on the Illustration layout.</b><br>
		      	<ul class="largeText">
	    			<li>
	    				“It's very detailed giving you information so you are making an informed decision before you select.”
	    			</li><br>
	    			<li>
	    				"This page is providing more descriptive info as to what each icon represents. It's explaining what they are and how it works."
	    			</li><br>
	    			<li>
	    				"You're actually explaining this to me now because I didn't know what a few of these were." 
	    			</li></br>

	    		</ul>

	    		<b>
	    		4 users from Group A and 1 user from Group B had positive comments on the Questionnaire layout.
	    		</b><br>
		      	<ul class="largeText">
	    			<li>
	    				"This layout (Questionnaire) is really nice and straightforward, I don't have to scroll to see all of the options which is nice especially if I was on a smaller screen."
	    			</li><br>
	    			<li>
	    				"I think that's (Questionnaire) great because the graphics make sense and the writing is plain.”
	    			</li><br>
	    			<li>
	    				“The choose device page is very simple and straightforward and the icons are helpful." (Questionnaire)
	    			</li></br>
	    			<!-- <li>
	    				“I like the second one (Questionnaire) because it goes based on what you have and what you use.”
	    			</li></br> -->
	    		</ul>


	    		<b>
	    			5 of 6 users in Group B felt confused or unsure about what a Security Key or PIV Card was since there is no context for what they are in the Questionnaire layout.
	    		</b><br>
		      	<ul class="largeText">
	    			<li>
	    				"I don't know about the security key or PIV. I've never been asked for them before." 
	    			</li><br>
	    			<li>
	    				"PIV card I don't know what that is. Security key I don't know what that is either" 
	    			</li><br>
	    			<li>
	    				“The illustration [Security Key] is not of much use to me. Similarly the PIV card, I'm not familiar with, nor does the picture or illustration tell me much about it.”
	    			</li></br>
	    		</ul>

	    		<b>
	    			8 out of 12 users preferred the “Illustration” direction over the “Questionnaire” direction since it offers descriptions up front.
	    		</b><br>
		      	<ul class="largeText">
	    			<li>
	    				"I'm going to go with the first one (Illustration) since it has little descriptions underneath, and that description can be very helpful. For me I know what it means but I'm sure other people could find it helpful."
	    			</li><br>
	    			<li>
	    				User preferred (Illustration) approach since it had all the descriptions listed in context. "I would have been quite lost without the explanations."
	    			</li><br>
	    			<li>
	    				“It's very detailed giving you information so you are making an informed decision before you select.”
	    			</li></br>
	    		</ul>

		<div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 	
	      	<h2>Outcomes & Impacts</h2>
		      	
		      	<p>
		      		From July 15 to July 18 2022, 50k users signed up with more than 1 MFA (multi-factor authentication method) on first account setup vs 192k users who selected just 1 MFA of those 192k users. 
		      	</p>
		      	<p>
		      		We had 55k go to the second MFA screen to select a secondary MFA. 192k / 105k makes for a 55% improvement in users selecting a 2nd MFA method. This prevents the likelihood of these users getting locked out of their accounts if they lose access to one of their MFAs.
