      		Designed an updated security key authentication method setup which led to a 50% percentage increase in user success rates immediately after new design implementation. Users could now see how to connect their USB security key in a step-by-step format with animated illustrations and a comprehensive help guide that addresses the most common issues users would run into.

      	<h2>The Challenge</h2>
	      	<p>
	      		In November 2021 Login.gov allowed users to set up only one Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) method from the MFA Selection screen when first creating an account. 
	      	</p>
	      	<p>
	      		Since the current functionality limits users to only setting up one authentication method at account creation, many users don't realize they can add multiple MFA methods from their account page. Having only one MFA method increases their chances of being locked out and needing to go through the account recovery process. 
	      	</p>
	  </div>


				  <div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 
      	<h2>Research Questions & Metrics</h2>
	      	<p>
	      		In order to prevent users from being locked out of their account and invoking the recovery process, we looked to test designs that encourage users to add at least two MFA methods during the account creation process.
	      	</p>
	      	<ol class="largeText">
    			<li>
    				How effective is the text content in convincing users to add a second MFA method on the first MFA selection screen?
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				How often will users only select one MFA method?
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				If users only select one MFA method will they add a 2nd method if they are prompted to later on in the account creation flow?
    			</li></br>
    			<li>
    				How many users will forgo adding a 2nd method even when given another chance to add another MFA method?
    			</li>
    		</ol>
	  </div>

	  




	  <div class="textCont2 largeText2">
       	<h2>Outcomes & Impacts</h2>
  		
        <p>
        	From July 15 to July 18 2022 today, 50k users signed up with more than 1 MFA (multi-factor authentication method) on first account setup vs 192k users who selected just 1 MFA of those 192k users we had 55k go to the second mfa screen and select a secondary MFA. 
        </p>  
        <p>
  			192k / 105k makes for a 55% improvement in users selecting a 2nd MFA method, which will prevent the likelihood of users getting locked out of their accounts if they lose access to one of their MFAs. 
        </p>
