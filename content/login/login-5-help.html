      	<p>
      		In late 2024, I joined Team Annie at Login.gov, taking on the challenge of redesigning the Login.gov Help Center. At the time, user satisfaction with help articles was low, averaging 48%.

      	<h2>The Challenge</h2>
	      	<p>
	      		How might we ensure Login.gov users can easily and quickly get the right information at the right time, enabling successful task completion without needing additional support?
	      	</p>

	      	<p>Why it matters:</p>
	      	<ul class="largeText">
    			<li>
    				Login.gov is a critical gateway to government services.
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Users have varying levels of technical familiarity.
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Existing help resources were not effectively meeting user needs, reflected by a user satisfaction rate of only 48%.
    			</li></br>
    		</ul>

			<h2>Approach & Process</h2>
	  		
	        <p>
	        	Our structured approach involved strategy and discovery phases to define clear objectives and understand user pain points through stakeholder interviews, data analytics, and user feedback. Key success metrics included increased user satisfaction, reduced support calls, and improved task completion rates.
	        </p>  
	        
	  </div>


	  <div class="textCont2 largeText2">

			<h2>Comparative Analysis</h2>
	  		
	        <p>
	        	We performed a detailed competitive analysis of industry-leading help centers, including Dyson, ID.me, Paypal, Google, Wealthfront, FedEx, Apple, Microsoft, Samsung, and Amazon. Each platform was evaluated based on:
	        </p>  
	        <ul class="largeText">
    			<li>
    				Search functionality: Prominent, dedicated help search bars.
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Content structure: FAQs prominently displayed, progressive disclosure using accordions.
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Visual differentiation: Clear visual cues and product-specific categorization.
    			</li></br>
    			<li>
    				Interactive assistance: Dedicated troubleshooting flows and conversational chatbots.
    			</li></br>
    		</ul>
	        <p>
	        	From these findings, we identified best practices such as question-based article framing, visual aids for topic differentiation, and interactive troubleshooting modules. These insights directly informed our redesign direction.

	  <div class="textCont2 largeText2">

			<h2>Design Prototyping</h2>
	  		
	        <p>
	        	Leveraging insights from the comparative analysis, we developed several interactive Figma prototypes that restructured the help center’s navigation and content layouts. Key enhancements included:
	        </p>  
	        <ul class="largeText">
    			<li>
    				Left-side navigation: Aligning with user mental models and best practices identified in competitor sites.
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Accordion-based content: Progressive disclosure to manage lengthy articles, helping users scan content more efficiently.
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				User-centric framing: Titles and content phrased as user questions and common troubleshooting scenarios to improve relevance and clarity.
    			</li></br>
    		</ul>
	        <p>
	        	Prototypes were iteratively refined based on internal team feedback, ensuring alignment with usability best practices and user expectations.
	        </p>

	  <div class="textCont2 largeText2">

			<h2>Usability Testing</h2>
	  		
	        <p>
	        	We conducted a remote moderated A/B/C usability test with 14 participants, comparing the existing help center against two distinct prototypes designed with our new approach.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        	Users were split into A/B and A/C groups.
	        </p>


	        <ul class="largeText">
    			<li>
    				Prototype preference: 10 out of 14 users favored the prototypes, noting quicker task resolution and improved ease of use.
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Navigation: Left-side navigation was preferred and significantly improved user performance compared to the existing right-side layout.
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Content clarity: Accordion structures were highly effective in breaking down complex content, enhancing scanability.
    			</li></br>
    			<li>
    				Visual guidance: Clear visual instructions and troubleshooting-oriented content strongly resonated with users, significantly outperforming purely informational content.
    			</li></br>
    		</ul>
	        <p>
	        	These insights demonstrated clear advantages of the redesigned prototypes over the existing help center, validating our design direction.

	  <div class="textCont2 largeText2">
      	<h2>Future Steps</h2>
      	<p>
      		Team Annie will look to continued refinement based on user satisfaction scores and clickthrough rates. We are also considering exploring dedicated troubleshooting flows for the most common issues in order to let contact center agents handle more complex issues.
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		This comprehensive redesign initiative aims to provide Login.gov users with intuitive, actionable support pathways, significantly improving their ability to navigate authentication and verification challenges.
