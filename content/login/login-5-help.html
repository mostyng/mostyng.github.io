      	<p>
      		In late 2024, I joined Team Annie at Login.gov, taking on the challenge of redesigning the Login.gov Help Center. At the time, user satisfaction with help articles was low, averaging 48%.

      	<h2>The Challenge</h2>
	      	<p>
	      		How might we ensure Login.gov users can easily and quickly get the right information at the right time, enabling successful task completion without needing additional support?
	      	</p>

	      	<p>Why it matters:</p>
	      	<ul class="largeText">
    			<li>
    				Login.gov is a critical gateway to government services.
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Users have varying levels of technical familiarity.
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Existing help resources were not effectively meeting user needs, reflected by a user satisfaction rate of only 48%.
    			</li></br>
    		</ul>

			<h2>Approach & Process</h2>
	  		
	        <p>
	        	I led design, content strategy, and research across five key stages:
	        </p>

	        <ol class="largeText">
    			<li>
    				Strategy: Conducted early discussions with stakeholders to align on scope. We decided that we would explore the navigation, help article formatting, and then refine content if users had feedback. 
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Discovery: Reviewed analytics to find the 48% user satisfaction stat and analyze call center support logs to reveal the most common help topics.
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Comparative Analysis: Benchmarked 10 help center websites in Google, Apple, Paypal, ID.me, Microsoft, Amazon, FedEx, Wealthfront, Dyson, and Samsung.
    			</li></br>
    			<li>
    				Design Prototyping: Took common design patterns identified in the comparative analysis and created two new design directions to prototype and test.
    			</li></br>
    			<li>
    				Usability Testing: Conducted A/B and A/C testing with 14 participants to determine the success of the prototypes against the current help center experience.
    			</li></br>
    		</ol>
	        
	  </div>


	  <div class="textCont2 largeText2">

			<h2>Comparative Analysis</h2>
	  		
	        <p>
	        	We performed a detailed comparative analysis of industry-leading help centers, including Google, Apple, Paypal, ID.me, Microsoft, Amazon, FedEx, Wealthfront, Dyson, and Samsung. Best practices we observed include:
	        </p>

	        <br>
	        <h3>Popular questions and FAQs displayed upfront</h3>
	        <p></p>

	        <br>

	        <img class="casestudy-pic" data-src="login-5-help-content/login-comp-analysis-2.png">

	        <br>
	        <h3>Question-based article titles (“Why isn’t my Face ID working?”) resonated more than technical titles</h3>
	        <img class="casestudy-pic" data-src="login-5-help-content/login-comp-analysis-3.png">

	        <br>
	        <h3>Progressive disclosure (accordions, decision trees) reduced cognitive overload</h3>
	        <img class="casestudy-pic" data-src="login-5-help-content/login-comp-analysis-4.png">

	        <br>
	        <h3>Left-side navigation was a consistent pattern, unlike Login.gov’s right-aligned nav</h3>

	        <br>
	        <p>
	        	The current Login.gov Help Center lacked many of the features stated above. It didn't feature any FAQs on the landing page seen below.

			<h2>Design Prototyping</h2>
	  		
	        <p>
	        	I created three prototypes to test structural and content approaches:
	        </p>  
	        <ul class="largeText">
    			<li>
    				Live Website: Refined IA and simplified labeling.
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Prototype B: Accordion-based help articles with collapsible sections.
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Prototype C: A conversational, step-by-step troubleshooting flow.
    			</li></br>
    		</ul>
	        <p>
	        	Key features I introduced:

	  <div class="textCont2 largeText2">

			<h2>Usability Testing</h2>
	  		
	        <p>
	        	We conducted a remote moderated A/B/C usability test with 14 participants, comparing the existing help center against two distinct prototypes designed with our new approach.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        	Users were split into A/B and A/C groups.
	        </p>


	        <ul class="largeText">
    			<li>
    				Prototype preference: 10 out of 14 users favored the prototypes, noting quicker task resolution and improved ease of use.
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Navigation: Left-side navigation was preferred and significantly improved user performance compared to the existing right-side layout.
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Content clarity: Accordion structures were highly effective in breaking down complex content, enhancing scanability.
    			</li></br>
    			<li>
    				Visual guidance: Clear visual instructions and troubleshooting-oriented content strongly resonated with users, significantly outperforming purely informational content.
    			</li></br>
    		</ul>
	        <p>
	        	These insights demonstrated clear advantages of the redesigned prototypes over the existing help center, validating our design direction.

	  <div class="textCont2 largeText2">
      	<h2>Future Steps</h2>
      	<p>
      		Team Annie will look to continued refinement based on user satisfaction scores and clickthrough rates. We are also considering exploring dedicated troubleshooting flows for the most common issues in order to let contact center agents handle more complex issues.
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		This comprehensive redesign initiative aims to provide Login.gov users with intuitive, actionable support pathways, significantly improving their ability to navigate authentication and verification challenges.
