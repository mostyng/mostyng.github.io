      	<h1>Redesigning the Login.gov Help Center</h1>
      	<p>
      		In late 2024, I joined Team Annie at Login.gov with the goal of redesigning the Login.gov Help Center. At the time, <b>user satisfaction with help articles was low (averaging 48%),</b> leading to an increased burden on the contact center team due to a higher volume of calls.
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		In my role as UX designer, writer, and researcher, I spearheaded a complete overhaul of the Help Center to improve online support for users facing authentication and identity verification issues.

	  <div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 
      	<h2>The Challenge</h2>
	      	<p>
	      		How might we ensure Login.gov users can easily and quickly get the right information at the right time, enabling successful task completion without needing additional support?
	      	</p>

	      	<p>Why it matters:</p>
	      	<ul class="largeText">
    			<li>
    				<b>Login.gov is a critical gateway to government services.</b> Any delay in access can cause profound damage to people's lives.
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				<b>Users have varying levels of technical familiarity.</b> Relevant troubleshooting guidance should be straightforward and easy to find.
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Existing help articles were not effectively meeting user needs, <b>reflected by a user satisfaction rate of only 48%.</b>
    			</li></br>

			<h2>The Help Center of 2024</h2>
	  		
	        <p>
	        	Outside of help article additions and updates, the original Help Center has not had a design update since its inception in 2021. The video below demonstrates a user attempting to find a solution to an authentication issue using the original site.
	        </p>  

    		<p>
	        	To find their specific help topic, they have to know whether it's under one of the five categories. Then we hope they even notice the right side navigation where their article may be. Once they're in the help article they might have to scroll through a large amount of content before finding relevant troubleshooting information.
	        </p>

			<h2>Comparative Analysis</h2>
	  		
	        <p>
	        	To get some inspiration, I performed a detailed comparative analysis of 10 industry-leading help centers including Google, Apple, Paypal, ID.me, Microsoft, Amazon, FedEx, Wealthfront, Dyson, and Samsung.
	        </p>
	        <p>Below are some of the best practices I identified from my analysis.</p><br>

	        <h3>1. Popular questions and FAQs are displayed upfront</h3>
	        <img class="casestudy-pic" data-src="login-5-help-content/login-comp-analysis-1.png">
	        <p>
	        	9/10 help sites featured popular issues or FAQs prominently at the top of the page. 5/10 framed these as “Popular topics”, “FAQ”, “Common questions”, or “Trending Topics”.
	        </p><br>
	        

	        <h3>2. Question-based article titles over technical titles</h3>
	        <img class="casestudy-pic" data-src="login-5-help-content/login-comp-analysis-3.png">
	        <p>7/10 help sites framed user issues through first-person questions like "What do I do if..." or "I can't sign in..."
	        </p>

	        <p>
	        The original Login.gov help center used second-person language like "Add or change your authentication method" or impersonal titles like "Help with agencies".
	        </p><br>

	        <br>
	        <h3>3. Progressive disclosure reduced cognitive overload</h3>
	        <img class="casestudy-pic" data-src="login-5-help-content/login-comp-analysis-4.png">
	        <p>6/10 help sites utilized the principle of progressive disclosure through collapsible accordions or paginated, step-by-step processes. 
	        </p>
	    	<p>This makes it easier for users to process information and make decisions to find solutions on their troubleshooting journey.</p><br>


	        <h3>4. Left side navigation was standard</h3>
	        <img class="casestudy-pic" data-src="login-5-help-content/login-comp-analysis-5.png">
	        <p>8/10 help sites featured a persistent left side navigation or related articles section within the context of a help article.</p>
	        <p>It was doubly important that we switched over to a left side navigation since it was a <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/side-navigation/">U.S. Web Design Systems</a> standard.
	        </p>
	        	<br>


	        <!-- <h3>Informing Prototypes</h3>
			<p>
				Following the comparative analysis, I decided to create two distinct prototypes (B and C) to test against the current Help Center (A). 
			</p>   -->
		

	  </div>







	  <div class="textCont2 largeText2">

			<h2>Designing Prototype B</h2>
	  		
	        <p>This design prototype prioritized speed and scannability by highlighting the most likely issues on the landing page, nesting detailed information within accordions, and creating navigation subsection links.</p>
	        <hr><br>
    		<p>
    			<b>Popular topics on the landing page:</b> By using the first-person question framing, the user should have an easier time finding the specific help article related to their issue.
    		</p>

	        <video class="casestudy-pic" loop muted autoplay playsinline>
	          <source src="login-5-help-content/login-help-b-accordion-1.webm" type="video/webm"/>
	        </video>
	        <hr><br>

	        <p>
    			<b>Accordions contain additional detailed information:</b> Longer help articles could be broken up into smaller sections using accordions to help with scanning.
    		</p>
	        <video class="casestudy-pic" loop muted autoplay playsinline>
	          <source src="login-5-help-content/login-help-b-ID.webm" type="video/webm"/>
	        </video>
	        <hr><br>

	         <p>
    			<b>Left side navigation with anchor links to subsections:</b> Users can easily scan and quickly navigate to the relevant section of the article by clicking on the subsection titles in the navigation.
    		</p>
	        <video class="casestudy-pic" loop muted autoplay playsinline>
	          <source src="login-5-help-content/login-help-b-nav.webm" type="video/webm"/>
	        </video>

	        
	    </div>



	    <div class="textCont2 largeText2">

			<h2>Designing Prototype C</h2>
	        <p>This design emphasized granularity by segmenting troubleshooting into a <b>step-by-step diagnostic process.</b> Users would be asked a series of questions and be given simple instructions before taking them to a longer form help article.</p>

	        <p>
	        	This approach was inspired by Dyson and Amazon's <b>conversational approach</b> to troubleshooting, thus making the experience less overwhelming for users.
	        </p>


	        <video class="casestudy-pic" loop muted autoplay playsinline>
	          <source src="login-5-help-content/login-help-c.webm" type="video/webm"/>
	        </video>

	    </div>





	  <div class="textCont2 largeText2">

			<h2>Usability Testing Results</h2>
	  		
	        <p>
	        	We conducted a remote moderated A/B/C usability test with <b>12 participants</b> on desktops, comparing the existing help center (A) against the two prototypes (B and C). Participants were split into four groups: A/B, B/A, A/C, and C/A. This was done to reduce potential recency bias.
	        </p><br>


	        <hr><br>
			<h3>Finding #1: Framing articles as user questions improved clarity and speed</h3>
	  		
	        <p>
	        	<q>I feel like I’m on the right page because I see that this is my question.</q>
	        </p>
	        
	         <p>
	         	<b>Takeaway:</b> Titles like “I’m having trouble with face or touch unlock" helped users find the right article faster than generic titles like “Authentication methods.”
			</p> <br>
			<hr><br>


			<h3>Finding #2: Accordion layouts improved scannability</h3>
	  		
	        <p>
	        	<q>I like the ability to collapse... looking through 5 or 6 dropdowns makes it easier.</q>
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        	<q>Long pages are overwhelming—I just scroll and hope something jumps out.</q>
	        </p>
	        
	         <p>
	         	<b>Takeaway:</b> Users preferred content broken into collapsible sections, which reduced cognitive overload and helped them zero in on relevant solutions.
			</p> <br>
			<hr><br>


			<h3>Finding #3: Users wanted step-by-step troubleshooting, not just definitions</h3>
	  		
	        <p>
	        	<q>It’s telling me how to set it up, but not how to troubleshoot.</q>
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        	<q>What action do I take if I’m having trouble logging in? It just says what it is, not how to fix it.</q>
	        </p>
	        
	         <p>
	         	<b>Takeaway:</b> Users would mistakenly land on irrelevant definitional articles when looking for solutions. Users wanted troubleshooting articles to be more prominent and distinct from informational articles.
			</p> <br>
			<hr><br>


			<h3>Finding #4: Left side navigation matched user expectations</h3>
	  		
	        <p>
	        	<q>It seems funny that all of these topics are on the right side. I’m used to seeing them on the left.</q>
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        	<q>Left side nav makes it easier to scan and jump between sections.</q>
	        </p>
	        
	         <p>
	         	<b>Takeaway:</b> The live site’s right side nav was often missed. Left side navigation aligned with USWDS patterns and user mental models.
			</p> <br>
			<hr><br>


			<h3>Finding #5: Both prototypes were preferred over the current experience</h3>

			<p>
				<q>It was easier. You're taking me through the steps to solve my problem instead of leaving me to figure it out.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>I like that I’m not just set free on a website—I’m being guided.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				10 out of 12 users favored the prototypes, noting quicker task resolution and improved ease of use. These insights demonstrated clear advantages of the redesigned prototypes over the existing help center, validating our design hypotheses.

	  <div class="textCont2 largeText2">
      	<h2>Implementation</h2>
      	<p>
      		After the usability study, the team decided to implement Prototype B's design since it performed the best and could be more easily rolled out in stages. Prototype C had similarly positive responses and dedicated troubleshooting flows for the top three most common issues are set to be further studied late 2025.
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		The redesigned Login.gov Help Center is set for partner preview and phased release in August 2025. Team Annie will look to continued refinement based on user satisfaction scores, clickthrough rates, and any fluctuations in contact center calls by topic.
      	</p>	
      	<p>
      		This redesign let me lead deeply across content strategy, interaction design, and user research. Our comparative analysis and usability testing enabled us to make targeted improvements that <b>helped users get to their answers faster, feel more confident, and reduce the burden on support teams.</b>
      	</p>
      	</div>	



	  <!-- <div class="textCont2 largeText2">
      	<h2>Future Steps</h2>
      	<p>
      		 Since prototype C had positive responses we are considering exploring dedicated troubleshooting flows for the most common issues in order to let contact center agents handle more complex issues.
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		This redesign let me lead deeply across content strategy, interaction design, and user research. By testing early and often, we made targeted improvements that helped users get to their answers faster, feel more confident, and reduce the burden on support teams.
