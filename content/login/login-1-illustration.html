      	<h1>Improving account creation success through iconography and content updates</h1>
      	<p>
      		When I first joined Login.gov, I was assigned to Team Katherine. This team is responsible for account creation and management.
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		We were tasked with making improvements to the authentication method selection page in order to increase comprehension, the adoption of more secure authentication methods, and to improve users' account security.
      	</p>
      </div>

	  <div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 
      	<h2>The Challenge</h2>
	      	<p>
	      		In 2021 Login.gov required users to set up at least one Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) method. Login previously utilized a labeling system that designated each MFA method as being more or less secure.
	      	</p>

	      	<img class="casestudy-pic greyBorder" data-src="login-1-illustration-content/login-MFA-2021.png">

	      	<p>
	      		This affected user confidence in their MFA choice since most users did not understand authentication apps and felt the phone was not a strong way to secure their account. Most users felt they were presented with more options than they were used to.
	      	</p>
	  </div>

	  <div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 
      	<h2>Goals & Questions</h2>
      		<p>
      			We are looking to determine which MFA selection design is most successful at:
      		</p>
      		<ul class="largeText">
    			<li>
    				Increasing user confidence in MFA method selection
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Bettering user understanding of MFA methods 
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Decreasing user time to making a selection 
    			</li></br>
    		</ul>

    		<p>The research questions we'd like to answer:</p>

	      	<ul class="largeText">
    			<li>
    				How well do users understand the different MFA methods?
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Do users feel confident in their MFA selections?
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Do icons help users make a quicker decision?
    			</li></br>
    			<li>
    				How does selecting by device first instead of method affect confidence, understanding, and time to making a decision?
    			</li></br>
    		</ul>
	  </div>




	  <div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 
      	<h2>Methodology</h2>

	      	<p>
	      		The team conducted unmoderated usability testing to learn more about how end users select MFA methods. The test was performed through UserTesting.com. Participants independently walked through a series of tasks and questions as they navigated 2 interactive prototypes.
	      	</p>
	      		
	      	<p>
	      		The team conducted 12 usability tests in 2 groups using two prototypes that showed both design versions just in different arrangements in order to diminish the <a href="https://measuringu.com/ut-bias/">recency/primacy bias.</a>
	      	</p>
	  </div>


		<div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 	
	      	<h2>A - Illustration Layout</h2>
	      	<p>
	      		To give new users more context we can provide them with illustrations that accompany each authentication method. The hypothesis was that users could scan through the options faster to make a decision.
	      	</p>

		<div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 	
	      	<h2>B - Questionnaire Layout</h2>
	      	<p>
	      		Using the principle of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/">progressive disclosure,</a> I wanted to have users select one or more devices in a list instead of having to read through each authentication option. The hypothesis was that users would have an easier time selecting the devices they were familiar with before being presented with authentication options.

	      	<h2>Research Results</h2>
	      		<p>
	      			All participants were able to successfully select an MFA method and comprehend how it secured their Login.gov account.
				</p>

	      		<b>4 of 6 participants from Group B had positive comments on the Illustration layout.</b><br>
		      	<ul class="largeText">
	    			<li>
	    				“It's very detailed giving you information so you are making an informed decision before you select.”
	    			</li><br>
	    			<li>
	    				"This page is providing more descriptive info as to what each icon represents. It's explaining what they are and how it works."
	    			</li><br>
	    			<li>
	    				"You're actually explaining this to me now because I didn't know what a few of these were." 
	    			</li></br>

	    		</ul>

	    		<b>
	    		4 participants from Group A and 1 user from Group B had positive comments on the Questionnaire layout.
	    		</b><br>
		      	<ul class="largeText">
	    			<li>
	    				"This layout (Questionnaire) is really nice and straightforward, I don't have to scroll to see all of the options which is nice especially if I was on a smaller screen."
	    			</li><br>
	    			<li>
	    				"I think that's (Questionnaire) great because the graphics make sense and the writing is plain.”
	    			<!-- </li><br>
	    			<li>
	    				“The choose device page is very simple and straightforward and the icons are helpful." (Questionnaire)
	    			</li></br> -->
	    			<li>
	    				“I like the second one (Questionnaire) because it goes based on what you have and what you use.”
	    			</li></br>
	    		</ul>


	    		<b>
	    			5 of 6 participants in Group B felt confused or unsure about what a Security Key or PIV Card was since there is no context for what they are in the Questionnaire layout.
	    		</b><br>
		      	<ul class="largeText">
	    			<li>
	    				"I don't know about the security key or PIV. I've never been asked for them before." 
	    			</li><br>
	    			<li>
	    				"PIV card I don't know what that is. Security key I don't know what that is either" 
	    			</li><br>
	    			<li>
	    				“The illustration [Security Key] is not of much use to me. Similarly the PIV card, I'm not familiar with, nor does the picture or illustration tell me much about it.”
	    			</li></br>
	    		</ul>

	    		<b>
	    			8 out of 12 participants preferred the “Illustration” direction over the “Questionnaire” direction since it offers descriptions up front.
	    		</b><br>
		      	<ul class="largeText">
	    			<li>
	    				"I'm going to go with the first one (Illustration) since it has little descriptions underneath, and that description can be very helpful. For me I know what it means but I'm sure other people could find it helpful."
	    			</li><br>
	    			<li>
	    				User preferred (Illustration) approach since it had all the descriptions listed in context. "I would have been quite lost without the explanations."
	    			</li><br>
	    			<li>
	    				“It's very detailed giving you information so you are making an informed decision before you select.”
	    			</li></br>
	    		</ul>
		</div>


		<div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 	
	      	<h2>Outcomes & Impacts</h2>
		      	<p>
		      		Though there was positive feedback for both directions we decided to implement the "Illustration" based authentication selection page. A majority of participants felt it provided more context up front. Some participants struggled with how the "Questionnaire" layout did not explain what each device was.
		      	</p>
		      	<p>
		      		From January to February 2022 there was an 83.7% account creation success rate. In March 2022 there was an improved 92.8% success rate [after launch of redesigned MFA setup page].
		      	</p>
		      	<p>
		      		"Based on this evidence I say that our efforts to streamline the MFA setup page had a positive impact on our users’ experience with Login. The visual design with icons and shorter descriptions helps make the process easier and apparently users are less inclined to give up.” - Doran Steele, Product Manager
