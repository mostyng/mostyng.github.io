First-year students in RISD Graphic Design, who take courses that look out onto the public space, have come up with proposals for flags — symbols meant to galvanize the public in some aspect of its shared experience. <a href="http://flags.risd.gd/">Click here to go to the site.</a>

These designs were made to stir up a conversation with the City and to speak to the public in lieu of (and perhaps in advance of) printed flags.
