      		<p>
      			We wanted to bring a sense
      		</p>
      		<ul class="largeText">
    			<li>
    				Increasing user confidence in MFA method selection
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Bettering user understanding of MFA methods 
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Decreasing user time to making a selection 
    			</li></br>
    		</ul>

    		<p>The research questions we'd like to answer:</p>

	      	<ul class="largeText">
    			<li>
    				How well do users understand the different MFA methods?
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Do users feel confident in their MFA selections?
    			</li><br>
    			<li>
    				Do icons help users make a quicker decision?
    			</li></br>
    			<li>
    				How does selecting by device first instead of method affect confidence, understanding, and time to making a decision?
    			</li></br>

      	<h2>Methodology</h2>

	      	<p>
	      		The team conducted unmoderated usability testing to learn more about how end users select MFA methods. The test was performed through UserTesting.com. Participants independently walked through a series of tasks and questions as they navigated 2 interactive prototypes.
	      	</p>
	      		
	      	<p>
	      		The team conducted 12 usability tests in 2 groups using two prototypes that showed both design versions just in different arrangements in order to diminish the <a href="https://measuringu.com/ut-bias/">recency/primacy bias.</a>

		      	<p>
		      		Following implementation the illustration-based authentication selection page led to an increase in Login.gov account creation success rates. 
		      	</p>
		      	<p>
		      		From January to February 2022: 83.7% account creation success rate. In March 2022: 92.8% success rate [after launch of redesigned MFA setup page]
		      	</p>
		      	<p>
		      		"Based on this evidence I say that our efforts to streamline the MFA setup page had a positive impact on our users’ experience with Login. The visual design with icons and shorter descriptions helps make the process easier and apparently users are less inclined to give up.” - Doran Steele, Product Manager
