      	<h2 class="rightText">The Process</h2>
      	<p>
      		My role in this project began with drafting visitors’ user journeys. I decided to segment each data visualisation into a modular story component. Visitors would have the choice to view whichever data module they found most compelling first or they could choose to move through each module sequentially.

	         	 	<p class="rightText">
	         	 		Following the initial UX process, I was then tasked with depicting what each data point would look like and how those data points would behave relative to each other in order to manifest a coherent and intelligible data visualisation.

			  <div class="textCont2 largeText2">
			  	<h2 class="rightText">Members</h2>
			  	<p>
			  		We decided to use glowing sprite-like nodes to depict each LinkedIn member. Each member node could take on a different colour and motion depending on the selected statistic. Transitions would be fluid between each data visualisation since each particle could freely move throughout the canvas.

	  	<h2 class="rightText">Takeaways</h2>
	  	<p>
	  		The opportunity to work with LinkedIn’s vast trove of data was as exciting as it was challenging. Technologists were initially worried about how to balance the experience’s performance with the vast quantity of data that needed to be processed and displayed. Luckily for us LinkedIn provided the computing hardware and APIs necessary for such a feat. 
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
	  		What began initially as a small dark conference room transformed into an immersive data-driven experiential activation space. With the installation complete, LinkedIn was now better able to demonstrate the scale and significance of their platform to potential clients and partners.
