	  	<h1>Uber – Lobby Experience</h1>
	  	<p>
	  		In 2019 worked at HUSH Studios in Brooklyn, NY to create an interactive lobby experience in Uber’s new headquarters in Mission Bay, San Francisco.
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
	  		Uber wanted to utilize their new global campus as a high-value setting to galvanize the company’s mission and culture, and help employees connect their contributions to positive, real-world impact.

	  	Visitors would walk towards the experience, trigger the interactive LED panels, and activate Uber’s content.

	  <div class="textCont2">
	  	<p>
	  		The team felt this idea carried the most potential since water, fluidity, and liquid could be conveyed in such varied ways. That and the fact that the concept evoked the most amount of movement meant that Stream was the idea that Uber decided to go ahead with. 
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
	  		Using Uber's wealth of content, we excitingly began to experiment with the various materials and digital manifestations that could be communicated within the lobby space.

	  	<p>
	  		Following reviews with Uber, the decision was to combine the best of both Zoom and Stream concepts to create a dynamic and fluid interactive experience.
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
	  		Our architectural designers decided we should cover the lobby space with LED powered tubes. The tubes allowed for text and image content to flow freely through the space in varying fidelities.
	  	</p>

	  </div>


	  <div class="textCont2">
	  	<p>
	  		Though the LED tubes were rigid, we wanted the content within to behave like a fluid. Content would come in from one end of the lobby to the other – beginning as loose particles that then coalesce. This composition created a compelling effect that translated well for both abstract moving patterns and video footage.

	  	<h2>Final Outcome</h2>
	  	<p>
	  		The Stream’s physical hardware and front-end visualization systems were designed for productization, modularity, and scalability. Following the deployment of The Stream in San Francisco, we scaled the work to Uber talent hubs in Dallas, Amsterdam, Chicago, and Mexico City.
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
	  		This system allows operations teams in Uber’s headquarters to distribute and evolve core storytelling across offices in real-time, encouraging a deep connection between global employees and the universal brand mission.
