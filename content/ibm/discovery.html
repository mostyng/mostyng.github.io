	      		Beginning in late 2018 the Watson Discovery design team visited clients in Japan in an effort to understand the needs of  business users. Designers sat side-by-side with the employees to see their current workflows firsthand. Through workshops, sponsor user feedback, and remote testing, we were able to piece together a clearer picture of “the business user” to see what Watson Discovery’s functionality could do for them.

	  	<h2>The Scenario</h2>
      	<p>
      		From the beginning of 2020, the CDC has been on top of everything COVID-19 related. Tanya is part of a large team of analysts and researchers responsible for finding, collecting, storing, and analyzing the vast quantity of news, scientific journal publications, infection rates, and hospital capacities among many other things.
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		Lucky for Tanya, Watson Discovery is here to help quickly consolidate her many disparate data sources. She creates a new project to begin.
      	</p>

	  </div>


	  <div class="textCont2 largeText2">
      	<p>
      		Tanya is presented with three project types upon entering the product. She selects ‘Document Retrieval’ since the CDC has tasked her with building a search engine to enable their scientists and analysts to evaluate and search through a constantly increasing mass of document and website data. 
      	</p>
      		<img class="casestudy-pic" data-src="discovery/disco-project-types.png">

	  <div class="textCont2 largeText2">
	  	<p>
      		Here, Tanya is able to upload or connect her data from a selection of different places. Everything from secure private databases to continually refreshed website crawls is available to her. She uploads a selection of recently published scientific articles.
	  	</p>
  		<img class="casestudy-pic" data-src="discovery/disco-project-upload.png">
	   </div>

	   <div class="textCont2 largeText2">
	  	<p>
	  		After uploading her data she is then prompted to highlight key elements within a small selection of her documents. Tanya tags a few headers, paragraphs, and images. In doing this, Watson Discovery can accurately replicate the highlighted patterns across Tanya's entire corpus of data after only a few pages of her labeling.

	   	          	A key issue with previous iterations of Discovery was the length of time it took Tanya to start testing her search engine. We made it a goal to get her testing queries within the first 20 minutes of her creating a project. To do this, we collaborated with our engineers to enable Discovery to take the top words or phrases (omitting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_word">stop words</a> of course) found within presently uploaded documents. We would then display the top 5 results to help give Tanya a way to immediately start testing out search queries.

      		Once she enters her first query, Tanya sees some tools she can use to improve the quality of her project. She likes the idea of providing her end-users with ways to more easily filter their search. She decides to click on “Create facets” in the Improvement panel on the right.

				To cater to their workflow, the out-of-box models retrieve pertinent information from the data and provide the user with a set of tools to customize their project. Business users can also react to changes and continuously iterate. This allows them to both meet their end goal and see small, valuable victories each step of the way.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our team's work led to improved time and cost savings and increased revenue through reduced employee workloads. In collaboration with our developers, we empowered customer employees to use cutting-edge natural language processing to spend less time searching for information and more time to act on valuable insights.
